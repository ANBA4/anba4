shall not be considered responsible for any damage, including partial or total
loss of data, resulting from the use of ANBA4 or from any implementation
bug of ANBA4 or any part of it.

As any software, Anba cannot be guaranteed to be totally bug-free. 
The user is also warned that there may be an appreciable difference 
between reality and the analytical models used in the implementation of the code, 
which are an idealization of reality.  Moreover, there may exist large 
uncertainties in the input data, whose collection 
and preparation is under the responsibility of the user.

As a consequence, the results of Computational Mechanics analyses should 
always be considered with care and interpreted by users with specific skills 
before relying on them, especially when safety is concerned.

Downloading the package implies the acceptance of these conditions
as well as of those stated in the sofwtare license.
